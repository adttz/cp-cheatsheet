# Dynamic Programming
### Recursive vs Iterative
- Recursive approach is Top-Down (Memoization)
- Iterative approach is Bottop-Up (Tabulation)

Example. Fibonacci series
- Using Memoization 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector< int > dp(n+1,0);
    int fib(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) return n;
        if(dp[n] != 0) return dp[n];
        return dp[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
};
```
- Using Tabulation
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int fib(int n) {
        if(n == 0 || n == 1) return n;
        vector< int > dp(n+1,-1);
        int dp[0] = 0; int dp[1] = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++){
            dp[i]= dp[i - 1]+ dp[i - 2];
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
#### Basic Theory:

- States : Represents the value(s) that the discarded information was compressed to, and also represents the subproblems we solve to build up to the main problem.
    - In Knapsack promlen, our state can be defined by two parameters index and weight i.e dp[index][weight].
<br>

- Transitions : Represents the way that states interact with each other
    - In the grid example, the iterative methodâ€™s transitions are pushing the answers to the downward and rightward cells: dp(r + 1, c) += dp(r, c); dp(r, c + 1) += dp(r, c)
    - The recursive transitions are given by the formula: dp(r, c) = dp(r - 1, c) + dp(r, c - 1)
<br>

- Base cases : Easiest states which we already know the answer to. dp[0] = 0, dp[0][0] = 1, etc.
<br>

- Push vs Pull DP : 
    - Pull DP "pulls" answer from previous DP values (recursive solution) ex. dp(r,c) = dp(r-1,c) + dp(r,c-1)
    - Recursive can only be pull dp.
    - Push DP "pushes" answer to future DP values (iterative solution) dp(r+1,c) += dp(r,c); dp(r,c+1) += dp(r,c)
